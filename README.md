# Yet Another Web Resume (YAWR) 

A (hopefully) dead simple way to create a web resume that doesn't look like it is
from the 90s. Powered by Angular JS and Bootstrap.

See [an example here](http://bing0fuel.github.com/YetAnotherWebResume)

## How to install/setup
1. Clone or fork (then clone) this repo.
1. Navigate to the repo directory
1. Fire up your favorite light-weight web server. My preference is the built-in
   PHP one: `php -S localhost:8080`. Then navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
   A sample version should be displaying.
1. To start modifying, point your editor to `ROOT/app/app.js`
1. Check out the Page variable, which is essentially a giant JSON with all of
   the data that YAWR needs to display itself.
1. Modify the blocks as needed. Currently, there are no docs to indicate which
   fields and/blocks are required. You'll need to do some experimentation.
1. Push to your hosting service. GitHub pages/GitHub.io is always a good
   choice. (See [pages.github](http://pages.github.com/) for more details)

## Todo
1. Documentation on how to modify
2. Interactive data generator
3. Load existing data into data generator for modification
